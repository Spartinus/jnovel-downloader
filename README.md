Want to read a light novel early but avoid using J-Novel Club's awful cloud reader? This is for you.

Using this userscript, you can simply hit 'G' while on a desired reading page and it'll automatically download a text file for you. From there, you can view it in a proper eBook reader like Freda or Calibre Viewer. 

*Please note that this is extremely basic and was originally intended for personal use; not planning to do anything more.*
